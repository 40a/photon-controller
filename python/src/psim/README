# Photon Controller Agent Place Simulator

## Overview
Placement Simulator, aka psim, is a program to simulate placement requests on
scheduler hierachy. It tries to build a scheduler tree based on user input,
then takes sample placement requests, simulating those requestw in scheduler
tree. The purpose of this simulator is to evaluate how good the placement
algorithm performances, in terms of distribution of loads, and so on.

## Caveat
Psim needs python 2.7.x since it is using argparse. You'd have to set
VERSIONER_PYTHON_VERSION=2.7 and then repeat the make develop shebang
to get the virtualenv based on 2.7.

## How to use psim
The CLI has 2 modes: interactive and batch. For interactive mode, psim takes
command from user standard input, parses it and executes it. For batch mode,
psim will read all commands from a file, and executes themm together.

### Interactive

    $ bin/psim

    Usages:

    sample [sampe_name]
    quit
    help
    > quit


### batch mode:

    $ cat samples/sample.cmd
    sample 1 2 3
    help

    $ bin/psim -r samples/sample.cmd
    #1 running sample 1 2 3
    running sample 1 2 3

    #2 running help
    Usages:

    sample [sampe_name]
    quit
    help
